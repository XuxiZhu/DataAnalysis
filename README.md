# DataAnalysis
Bank churn rate regression and prediction  

The dataset we chose is based on information regarding credit card customers. 
The dataset came from the website Kaggle.com, which is traditionally known for having datasets that are conducive to Machine Learning oriented problems, but the one we chose works very well for this project as well. 
The original dataset, before we did any cleaning, contained over 10000 observations, each with 24 variables. 
Each observation (row) represents a customer and the variables consist of information about the customer.
